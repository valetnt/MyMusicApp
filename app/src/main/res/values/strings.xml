    <string name="MainActivity_label">MAIN ACTIVITY (HOME):</string>
    <string name="MainActivity_description">This is the launcher activity. The screen layout should
        be designed in such a way that it incourages the user to explore new music.
        For example, there could be a search bar that allows the user to search for whatever song or
        album or artist he has in mind at the moment, searching through his own library and
        also through the music store.
        The search bar should implement auto-complete, in order to help the user reach right what he
        is looking for.
        If what he is looking for is contained in his library, the suggested search result(s) should
        point there, to that particular artist, album or song. More precisely, an intent should be
        sent to either "Artist" or "Album" or "PlaySingle" activity. In case what he is looking for
        is not contained in his library, then the suggested search result(s) should point to the
        store, more precisely to a hierarchical child of a possible "MusicStore" activity
        (which I have not implemented, although it appears in the navigation drawer).
        The screen could also contain suggestions for new, popular or recommended music to purchase
        on the store.
        Suggestions are organized in horizontally scrollable RecycleViews. Again, by clicking on
        one of these items, an intent is sent to a hierarchical child of the "MusicStore" activity.
        If you click on one of the "recently purchased" items, an intent is sent to "Album", so
        that this recently purchased album with all its songs is shown.
